# Renaissance thema
Thema voor de nieuwe Renaissance website.

## Important!!!
* Use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) as the editor for this project.
* Visual Studio Code [supports Git out of the box](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/versioncontrol), so use it.
* __Make multiple, small atomic commits__! So don't bundle multiple changes into one single commit but use a commit for each small change or addition.
* Use a clear commit description, if possible in English.
* Make sure to install the extension [Beautify](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=HookyQR.beautify).
* Run Beautify for each (source) file you intend to commit by pressing `Ctrl+Shift+P` and then typing in/choosing `Beautify file`.
